## Reuse and provenance

Instructions in this bundle are newly composed adaptations of the audited workflows; they are not verbatim upstream manifests. Modified naming, routing, authorization, failure reporting and host selection are intentional. Source scripts, exact wire schemas and provider clients are not implicitly included.

ARIS root MIT is not a component-level clearance; writing/figure acknowledgments and external dependencies need separate provenance review. See the plugin root LICENSE and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md before redistribution. Per-skill installation also includes the applicable notices in this directory.
